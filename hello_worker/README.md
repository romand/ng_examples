# HelloWorker Example

This is the simplest example you can find and is a great place to start. It simply logs some output to the worker log.

1. Be sure you've done your one time configuration
2. Run `iron_worker codes.create -n HelloWorker`
3. Run `ruby enqueue.rb`
4. Look at [HUD](https://hud.iron.io) to view your tasks running, check logs, etc.
