# HelloWorker Example

This is the simplest example you can find and is a great place to start. It simply logs some output to the worker log.

1. Be sure you've setup your .iron.json file.
2. Run `iron_worker codes.create -n hello`
3. Run `ruby enqueue.rb`
4. Look at [HUD](https://hud.iron.io) to view your tasks running, check logs, etc.
